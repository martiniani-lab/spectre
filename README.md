# spectre

This repositry contains scripts used to generate figures in the paper titled: "Explicit rational function solutions for the power spectral density of stochastic linear time-invariant systems."

The folder 'spectrum_general' contains classes to calculate the spectrum of an LTI SDE with a given Jacobian (J) and noise matrices (L and S), using the matrix, recursive, simulation and element-wise solution.

The folder 'model_classes' contains classes for the individual models described by nonlinear SDEs exhibiting a fixed point solution. 

The folder 'plotting_scripts' contains jupyter notebooks used to generate the plots for the models.
